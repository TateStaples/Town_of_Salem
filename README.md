# Town_of_Salem
One of my first projects. This is a simple implementation of the mafia-like game called town of salem. It uses sockets to allow for multiplayer playing on a LAN network.

Taught me how to effectively use OOP, inheritance, and Polymorphism. It was a lot of fun to make and I had a great time playing it with some friends.

## Lessons
- GUI implements
- networking
- OOP
- file organization
